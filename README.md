# RequirementsEngineering
For the requirements engineering and analysis class I worked with a sponsor from Alaska Airlines to help improve efficiency of airline scheduling. I developed a business requirement specification document and software requirements specification document for the project. I utilized Jira and Confluence to document the project, create a requirements backlog, and share updates with stakeholders.
